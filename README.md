# Offshore Wind OM
Currently, offshore wind simulators are tightly held software packages which users cannot easily gain access too. Instead, the owners of the software often have to perform the analysis for you. This code will be a free open source offshore wind O&M simulation that anyone can use for research purposes. The code will run a stochastic monte-carlo discrete event based simulation of the operations and maintenance of an offshore windfarm. The code is broken down into several inputs:

Weather
Wind turbine
Vessels
Technicians
Maintenance strategy
Simulator

The code will have a foundational ability to run O&M simulations, allowing anyone to use the model. However, the hope is that by making the code open source anyone can expand the code to their own specific use cases.
